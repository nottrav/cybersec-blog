## What this is

Started as a school project, now an evolving space where I write about cybersecurity, privacy, and staying safe online - plus showcase work I'm proud of.

I publish when inspiration strikes: deep dives into how things work, opinion pieces on digital rights, and occasional walkthroughs. The throughline is making security and privacy accessible without fear-mongering.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Framework | [Astro](https://astro.build/) — static site generation, minimal JS |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Content | Markdown |
| Deployment | Netlify |
| Previous life | WordPress (migrated for performance and simplicity) |

**Why Astro?** I wanted something fast by default, with less abstraction between me and the final HTML. The WordPress plugin ecosystem had become a liability - this rebuild cut load times dramatically and gave me full control over the design.
