The Convenience Trap is a three-part capstone blog series that explores why users consistently trade privacy for convenience.

The project focuses on how interface defaults, social pressures, and fast decision paths shape behavior online.

## Project goals

- Turn privacy research into clear writing for non-technical readers.

## Outcome
