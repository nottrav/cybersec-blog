This project was completed as a group assignment focused on building an enterprise privacy policy framework.

My primary contribution was **Deliverable 1**, where I defined core policy foundations and risk controls for handling sensitive data.

## What I worked on

- Defined PII classifications and governance role expectations
- Analyzed privacy risk scenarios and likely failure points
- Proposed safeguards including encryption and access controls
- Structured incident response and privacy accountability procedures
