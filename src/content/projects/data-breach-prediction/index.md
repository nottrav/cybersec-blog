This project focused on using historical incident data to estimate breach likelihood and identify the strongest predictive signals.

## What I worked on

- Built a predictive regression model from real breach incident records
- Engineered features from raw/unstructured data in Excel
- Evaluated which variables had the strongest predictive value
- Identified prior breach history as a leading indicator of future incidents
