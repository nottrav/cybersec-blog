For my capstone project, I want to create a blog series that explores one of the most important questions in today’s digital world: how much privacy are people willing to trade for convenience? This tension is at the heart of cybersecurity, and it shows up in small choices every day, whether it is clicking “accept all cookies,” using the same password across multiple accounts, or linking personal data to third party apps. Through this series, I hope to unpack these choices and make cybersecurity more approachable for the everyday digital user.

I envision creating a blog series as my project. Blogging appeals to me because it allows for both depth and flexibility. Instead of presenting everything in one long format, I can publish a sequence of posts that each focus on a specific angle of the privacy convenience issue, such as app permissions, social media sharing, or online shopping habits. This structure makes the content easier to digest and also encourages readers to come back for future posts. The blog format gives me room to use multimedia elements like infographics, screenshots of real world examples, and links to credible sources. These elements will help me communicate complex ideas in a way that is visual, clear, and engaging.

The subject I want to explore is the privacy convenience trade off in digital life. This topic interests me because it connects to my academic focus in information technology and my personal interest in cybersecurity. I have become more careful about using encrypted apps, unique passwords, and secure storage, but I still notice how tempting it can be to choose convenience over security. That tension feels worth investigating because it affects nearly everyone who uses technology.

Some of the questions I plan to address include:

Why do people knowingly sacrifice privacy for ease of use?

What are the long term risks of constantly giving away small pieces of data?

What practical steps can individuals take to protect themselves without overcomplicating their digital lives?

This topic has the potential to engage a broad audience because it blends practical advice with critical reflection. Many people do not see cybersecurity as relevant until something goes wrong. By writing in an accessible style and grounding my posts in relatable examples, I hope to add value to discussions about digital life and encourage readers to think differently about their choices online.

My vision is to create a blog series that bridges the gap between technical cybersecurity concepts and the everyday decisions people make online. By focusing on the privacy convenience trade off, I want to produce posts that are informative, relatable, and thought-provoking. Feedback on which subtopics to emphasize, whether daily habits, broader digital culture, or emerging threats, would help me refine the direction of this project.
