Today, I am excited to share my final podcast project for the course.

This podcast focuses on personal cybersecurity awareness, offering simple and practical advice that everyday users can apply to protect themselves online.

The format of the podcast follows a clear structure.

It begins with an introduction that explains the purpose of the podcast, the website it supports, and the nonprofit organization highlighted in the episode.

Listeners will first hear a short public service announcement promoting the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an organization that defends digital rights and online privacy.

After the PSA, the main content addresses several important cybersecurity topics.

These include how to recognize phishing scams, the importance of creating strong and unique passwords, the dangers of using public Wi-Fi without protection, and easy ways to enhance online safety through free tools like password managers, VPNs, and browser extensions.

Some trusted VPN services featured in the episode include ProtonVPN and Mullvad.

The podcast is presented in a solo format, without guest interviews, to maintain a clear and focused delivery.

Background music is included during the introduction and conclusion, and a friendly, accessible tone is maintained throughout the episode to match the needs of non-technical users who are seeking simple online safety strategies.
