As the semester wraps up, I've had the chance to reflect on some key skills and experiences from this course that truly stood out. Among all the assignments and projects, here are my **three most memorable takeaways**:

## 1. Learning How to Create and Manage a Website

Before this course, websites seemed complicated and overwhelming. However, this class introduced me to **WordPress** and showed me how manageable and enjoyable building a website could be.

I learned how to:
- Set up pages and create engaging posts
- Embed media and design clear navigation
- Experiment and customize my website

This practical skill was exciting because I saw **immediate results** each time I published content. The ability to experiment and customize my website taught me valuable **digital communication skills** I'll definitely use again in future projects.

## 2. Using SoundCloud to Produce a Podcast

One particularly memorable part of the course was making a podcast-style audio project using **SoundCloud**, which I'd never done before. Initially, the idea of recording and publishing audio seemed daunting, but once I dove in, the process became surprisingly intuitive.

Learning how to **edit audio**, **structure an engaging narrative**, and ultimately share my voice online gave me a new appreciation for **audio storytelling**. This project not only introduced me to a new medium but also boosted my confidence in trying new digital tools.

## 3. Understanding the Power of Digital Storytelling

Another takeaway that genuinely impacted me was discovering how powerful **digital storytelling** could be in connecting with an audience.

Through combining **written text**, **visual elements**, and **audio**, I realized that storytelling online goes beyond just writing words on a page. Our final project challenged me to integrate these components effectively, creating a cohesive and engaging experience. This skill will undoubtedly shape how I approach communication in future professional or personal projects.

## Looking Back

These three takeaways (**website building**, **podcast creation with SoundCloud**, and **mastering digital storytelling**) have given me new skills and confidence. This course was more than just credits toward graduation; it provided practical tools I'll continue using well into the future!
