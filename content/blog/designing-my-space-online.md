When I first started building my website, I didn’t realize how much goes into making a space that feels both personal and professional. My goal was to create a platform where I could share my insights, experiences, and passion for cybersecurity while building a brand that reflects who I am. I wanted visitors to leave with something valuable, whether that’s a new perspective, a useful tip, or simply a sense of curiosity about technology and online privacy.

Choosing the right layout was the first big step. I went with a design that felt clean, modern, and easy to navigate. I wanted something that was visually appealing without feeling cluttered. The template I used already came with a few main sections, and I customized them by removing what I didn’t need and renaming others to better fit my goals. For example, I kept a simple navigation bar with pages like “Home,” “About,” and “Blog,” because I wanted the experience to feel intuitive for anyone visiting for the first time.

Color was another part I’ve been experimenting with. I haven’t finalized my palette yet, but I’m drawn to green and earthy tones, colors that feel natural and balanced. I plan to test a few combinations before launching the final version, but the goal is to keep it easy on the eyes while still feeling distinct.

Learning WordPress was easily the biggest challenge so far. Before this project, I had never built a full site from scratch. At first, I struggled with how to adjust layouts, organize widgets, and manage content. It was overwhelming to navigate all the tools and customization options. The turning point came when I started reading WordPress’s help guides and browsing online articles. I also watched a lot of YouTube tutorials, which helped me visualize what I was doing wrong and how to fix it. Slowly, I began to understand.

Working through these challenges helped me grow in areas I hadn’t expected. I became more thoughtful about design, navigation, and user experience. I also learned how much small details, like font choice or image placement, can shape how a website feels. As I worked, I realized that building a digital space isn’t just about making something that looks good. It’s about making something that works for the audience you want to reach.

Everything I’m building ties back to my goal of working in cybersecurity. The site gives me a platform to explore stories, trends, and insights about staying safe online. I want people to feel intrigued when they visit, like they just learned something interesting about phishing, privacy, or security breaches. If I can get someone to think twice about what they click or how they protect their information, then I’ve done my job.

Building this site has been a learning experience from start to finish. It’s taught me patience, creativity, and the value of continuous learning. More than anything, it’s shown me that web development isn’t just about coding, it’s about communication. Every choice you make, from layout to color, tells part of your story. And this website is the beginning of mine.
