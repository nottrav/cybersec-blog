I nuked my old website this week. Same URL, completely different bones underneath. It was WordPress before. Paid hosting, plugin bloat, pages that loaded like molasses. I'd accepted the slowness like weather, something I couldn't change.

Then I tried to update a plugin and the whole admin panel went white. Classic white screen of death. Fixed it eventually. Sat there afterward thinking: I'm paying for this.

Started looking at alternatives that night. Landed on Astro and Netlify. Static site, Markdown files, no database. Push to GitHub, site updates. Clean. Fast. Under my control.

## The Migration Became a Redesign

The migration became a redesign. Cleaner type, a dark mode toggle for the night owls. Gave my Convenience Trap series, three posts on how frictionless tech quietly costs us privacy, a home that loads in under a second.

## The Real Pain

The real pain? Getting my old posts out. WordPress handed me an XML file, this bloated export full of tags, metadata, and formatting I didn't need. Converting that to Markdown took longer than building the new site.

I lost an afternoon to regex and trial and error, watching my old posts break in new and exciting ways. Paragraphs that wouldn't split. Characters that rendered as gibberish. Links that pointed nowhere.

## But It's Done Now

But it's done now. The site loads fast, I understand how it works, and adding a post means opening a file instead of wrestling with a dashboard.

The site's live. Let me know if you hit anything weird, or if it's fast enough that you notice.
